						<h1>Section 1 - Acquire</h1>
						<p>
							This stage involves searching for datasets that I could later use in Tableau to create visualisations. It took me
							a while to find a suitable datatset. I eventually settled on a crime dataset that detailed crime (violent
							and non-violent) in the US from 1960 - 2019 that was on a GitHub and sourced from the FBI. 
							I got two more datasets one also sourced from the FBI and the last from Kaggle. These datasets dealt with 
							various factors that may contribute to crimes such as poverty rate and median household income from the 
							second dataset and opioid deaths from the third dataset.They were all formatted the same way and contained 
							a key column so they could be connected in Tableau later. 
						</p>
						
						<br>

						<p>Main Dataset:</p>
						<img src="imgs/acquire1_main.png" alt="No Image" style="width: 1250px; height: auto; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px;">



					</div>
					
					<div id="stage2" class="container-fluid bg-info text-black;" style="padding:100px 20px;">
						<h1>Section 2 - Parse</h1>
						<p>
							This involved me editing the datasets. I would go through the datasets and use forumals to see if there any 
							missing values that needed to be dropped or imputed. I highlighted the columns that I wanted to keep later in yellow,
							the columns I wanted to keep but had to edit in some way in orange and the columns I didn't want were left untouched.
							I also made the column names more readable.
						</p>

							<br>

							<p>Example of my editing process:</p>
							<img src="imgs/parse3_opioids.png" alt="No Image" style="width: 1250px; height: auto;">

						
					</div>
					
					<div id="stage3" class="container-fluid bg-secondary text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
						<h1>Section 3 - Filter</h1>
						<p>This stage involved me removing any superfluous columns. I just deleted the columns I had not marked 
							from the previous section or I felt I could not do any good visualisations from or extract any menaingful 
							data.

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							Example of filtered dataset:
						</p>

							<img src="imgs\filter2_median.png" alt="No Image">

					
					</div>

					<div id="stage4" class="container-fluid text-black" style="padding:100px 20px;">
						<h1>Section 4 - Mine</h1>
						<p>
							The Mine Stage involves looking for any meaningful data or patterns before visualisations begin with the 
							remaining data. At this stage I created a calculated field by adding two columns togehter (violent and 
							non-violent crime per state) and took the years and divided them up into decades and called this new column 
							"Decades". I was also able to connect the datasets through their key column "State" so I could compare all 
							three. Finally, I conducted a R-Squared statistical test to find how related population was to both violent 
							and non-violent crime. It was slightly related to non-violent but not so much for violent.

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
						
							Example of calculated field creation:
						</p>

					</div>

					<div id="stage5" class="container-fluid bg-secondary text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
						<h1>Section 5 - Represent</h1>
						<p>
							The Represent Stage required me to start making basic graphs and visualisations around my data. This means I 
							just have make a basic graph of what I want with no filters or marks. This is when I was deciding what would
							be the best graphs to show my data off before adding anymore detail and gives a very basic overview of what 
							they will look like eventually.

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							Example of basic graph with little detail added:
						</p>

						<img src="imgs\represent1.png" alt="No Image">
						
					</div>

					<div id="stage6" class="container-fluid bg-secondary text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
						<h1>Section 6 - Refine</h1>
						<p>
							This stage involved refining how your graphs look and adding more detail to them. To do this I would add colours
							to show the density of crimes, I would add numbers and marks to charts, along with colour to display 
							different things and added legends to explain in better detail what my graphs meant.

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							Example of refinement:
						</p>

						<img src = "imgs\refine1.png" alt="No Image">
						
					</div>

					<div id="stage7" class="container-fluid bg-primary text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
						<h1>Section 7 - Interaction</h1>
						<p>
							This stage involves adding some sort of ineteration with any graphs that can have one. I just added a
							filter for years so any year or multiple years could be selected to show the amount of violent or 
							non-violent crime that had been committed by state, respectively. 

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							Example of interaction:

							<div class="p-3 border bg-light">
								<p> Democrat states were elected less but yet they had higher overall crime than Republican states. 
									This could be due to some states being more populated than the others but this was measured per 
									capita (per 100K). Split states were the most common and had to most crime. Crime was also at it's 
									worst in the 1980's and 1990's. This could be due to less reporting or proof due to the lack 
									of technology back then (e.g., smartphones).
								</p>

						</div>
				
						<!-- Section 2 -->
						<div class="col-md-4">
							<div class="p-3 border bg-light">
								<p> Population also wasn’t a leading factor for crime being committed either. It was also hard to 
									pinpoint an exact cause for causes for crimes as the different potential factors didn’t point to 
									any one conclusion (e.g., Maryland was in the top three for crime overall but had relatively low 
									unemployment, opioid deaths and poverty and a decently high median household income). 
									The likelihood is that these factors do contribute to some degree but the problems for crime may 
									stem deeper.

						<!-- Section 3 -->
						<div class="col-md-4">
							<div class="p-3 border bg-light">
								<p> Overall, there were some interesting discoveries that were made but I would need more data and time 
									to draw more definitive conclusions about why crime might be the way that it is and what in recent 
									decades had mitigated it compared to the earlier decades.
